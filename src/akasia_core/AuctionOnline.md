The bidding process for an online auction can vary depending on the auction site, but most websites follow a similar bidding flow. Here are the general steps to bidding in an online auction:

- Create an online account: Before you can start bidding, you must create an account on the auction website. Most sites also allow you to store a payment method on the account to simplify your auction experience
- Locate the auction page: Visit an auctioneerâ€™s website to find their page and a list of their upcoming auctions. The listings will include the link to the bidding page, the auction dates and other important information. Simply follow the link to the auction page and log in with your account
- Register for the auction: You will find the option to register for the event on the auction page. Registration includes a form for you to fill out so the auctioneer can verify your identity. The information needed depends on the auctioneer. Many auctioneers will require you to submit a credit card number for verification 
- Obtain approval from the auctioneer: Your auctioneer will review your registration information to determine whether you are a legitimate bidder. This process usually takes between one to two days 

Once you are approved and registered, you can start bidding on items. The online bidding process starts by offering the product at a predetermined base price. Every time a bid is placed, the productâ€™s price increases by a fixed amount.Bidders also have to pay a small fee each time they bid
