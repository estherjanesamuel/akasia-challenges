> This flowchart shows the process of a vehicle entering the gas station and selecting the appropriate gasoline type. The vehicle then enters the queue for the selected gasoline type and waits for an available station. Once a station becomes available, the vehicle moves forward to fill up. This is just one possible way to represent the process and you can modify it to better suit your needs.
